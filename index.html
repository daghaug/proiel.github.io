          The PROIEL Treebank is a dependency treebank with
          morphosyntactic and information-structure annotation. It includes
          texts in several ancient Indo-European languages and is freely
          available under a <a
          href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">
          Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
          License</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The treebank was started as part of the research
          project <a
          href="http://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/projects/proiel/">Pragmatic
          Resources in Old Indo-European Languages</a>, which was financed by the
          Norwegian Research Council. It originally comprised the New Testament in
          Ancient Greek and its translations into Latin, Old Church Slavonic,
          Gothic and Armenian. The treebank has since been expanded to
          include ancient Indo-European texts in general, and it is still in active
          development.
