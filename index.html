        <p>
          The PROIEL Treebank is a treebank of ancient Indo-European languages, including Latin and Ancient Greek. It uses a refined version of dependency grammar and is available under a <a
          href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">
          Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
          License</a>. On this site you will find our official, versioned releases of the treebank and pointers to further information.

        <p>
          The PROIEL Treebank is one of three treebanks that use the same annotation system, follow the
          same principles and available under the same license. The PROIEL Treebank covers Ancient Greek and Latin, as well as the translations of the New Testament into Gothic, Armenian and Old Church Slavonic. The [TOROT Treebank](http://torottreebank.github.io/) covers Old Church Slavonic, Old Russian and Middle Russian, while the [ISWOC Treebank](https://iswoc.github.io/) includes texts in Old English, Old French, Portuguese and Spanish. The complete collection currently has 928,037 tokens, all of which has been manually annotated with morphological and syntactic analyses. Parts of the treebank also have information-structure annotation and the New Testament texts include text alignment.

        <h2>Annotation system</h2>

        <p>
          The morphosyntactic annotation scheme is described in the document
          <a href="http://folk.uio.no/daghaug/syntactic_guidelines.pdf">PROIEL
            Guidelines for Annotation</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          The treebank was started as part of the research
          project <a
          href="http://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/projects/proiel/">Pragmatic
          Resources in Old Indo-European Languages</a>, which was financed by the
          Norwegian Research Council. It originally comprised the New Testament in
          Ancient Greek and its translations into Latin, Old Church Slavonic,
          Gothic and Armenian. The treebank has since been expanded to
          include ancient Indo-European texts in general and has spawned the [TOROT](http://torottreebank.github.io/) and [ISWOC](https://iswoc.github.io/)
          treebanks, which are complementary to the PROIEL Treebank.
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>

        <p>
          Releases are hosted on <a
          href="https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/">Github</a>, where
          you can also access <a
          href="https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/releases">previous
          releases</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Access to raw data</h2>

        <p>
          Our releases contain the treebank on our own [PROIEL XML format](http://proiel.github.io/handbook/developer/proielxml.html). PROIEL XML is the authoritative format for PROIEL-style treebank and the only one that provides access to all the annotation we have, but for ease of use we also include the treebank as CoNLL-X and CoNLL-U files. We have [a command-line utility](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-cli) that can be used to convert PROIEL XML to various other formats (see the [documentation](http://proiel.github.io/handbook/developer/cli.html) for examples), including formats used for training taggers. For more complex tasks we have a [Ruby library](https://github.com/proiel/proiel), which is quite well [documented](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/proiel).
